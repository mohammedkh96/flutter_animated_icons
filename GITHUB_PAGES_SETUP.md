# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Deploy Your Flutter Animated Icons Demo to GitHub Pages

Your Flutter animated icons example is now ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages! Follow these steps to make it live:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/hajisalam/flutter_icons_animated`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 2: Trigger the Deployment
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run when you push to the main branch. Since we just pushed the setup files, the deployment should start automatically.

To manually trigger it:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow run for "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click on it to monitor the deployment progress

### Step 3: Access Your Live Demo
Once the deployment is complete (usually takes 2-5 minutes), your demo will be available at:
```
https://hajisalam.github.io/flutter_icons_animated/
```

### What's Included
- **Landing Page**: Beautiful landing page with project description
- **Interactive Demo**: Full Flutter web app showcasing all 2400+ animated icons
- **Features**:
  - Search and filter icons by library and category
  - Dark/Light theme toggle
  - Auto-play animations
  - Responsive design
  - Click to animate individual icons

### Automatic Updates
Every time you push changes to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build the Flutter web app
2. Deploy it to GitHub Pages
3. Update the live demo automatically

### Troubleshooting
If the deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Custom Domain (Optional)
To use a custom domain:
1. Add your domain to the `cname` field in the workflow file
2. Create a `CNAME` file in your repository root with your domain
3. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
